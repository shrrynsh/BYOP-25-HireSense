## BYOP-25-HireSense

# HireSense ✨

This repository contains a **Candidate Selection Model "HireSense"** designed to parse resumes and job descriptions (JDs) into JSON format using fine-tuned NER models, and calculate the similarity between them using embeddings generated by the **T5 model**. 🌐

---

## 🔢 Project Structure
The project includes the following Python notebooks:

1. **📄 jdnertrainnotebooknew**
   - Contains the training code for the **Job Description Parser Model**.

2. **📄 resumenertrainnotebooknew**
   - Contains the training code for the **Resume Parser Model**.

3. **📄 finalbyopnew**
   - Loads the trained models and demonstrates the process of parsing resumes and JDs into JSON format.
   - Generates embeddings using the **T5 model**.
   - Calculates the similarity of an **Electrical Engineer JD** with resumes of an Electrical Engineer, Animator, and Bar Tender.

## 📂 Input Formats (TO BE GIVEN IN THE THIRD NOTEBOOK)
### 🔑 Resumes:
To process resumes, use the following format:
```python
text = text_preprocess(pdf_load("path of the resume"))

ensemble = EnsembleNERResume(
    pretrained_model_path="/kaggle/input/vvvvvvvvvvvvv/resume_ner_model_pickle.pkl",
    device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
)

predictions = ensemble.predict(text)

parsed_resume = group_entities_unique_resume(predictions)
```
Here, `parsed_resume` contains the parsed resume in **JSON format**. 🔐

### 🔑 Job Descriptions:
To process JDs, use the following format:
```python
jd = text_preprocess("type your jd here")

ensemble = EnsembleNERJd(
    pretrained_model_path="/kaggle/input/vvvvvvvvvvvvv/jd_ner_model_pickle.pkl",
    device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
)

predictionsjd = ensemble.predict(jd)

parsed_jd = group_entities_unique_jd(predictionsjd)
```
Here, `parsed_jd` contains the parsed JD in **JSON format**. 🔐

### 🔍 Similarity Calculation:
Upload the `parsed_resume` and `parsed_jd` into the `eval()` function in the third notebook to calculate the **similarity score**. 🔎

## 📝 How to Run the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository: 🔧
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Open the desired notebook in **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or any compatible IDE. 🌐

3. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to:
   - Load and parse resumes and JDs. 🔑
   - Calculate similarity scores. 🔍

4. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. For the third notebook, upload the resumes and JDs for which embeddings need to be calculated, and follow the prescribed formats to process them. 🔄

---

## 🎮 Notes
- The embeddings are generated using a **T5 model**. ✨
- Ensure that the pretrained model paths for `resume_ner_model_pickle.pkl` and `jd_ner_model_pickle.pkl` are correctly specified.
- Use the provided **training data** to test the model's functionality. 📚

This project simplifies the **candidate selection process** by automating the parsing of resumes and job descriptions and computing their similarity effectively. 🚀

Enjoy exploring and enhancing the model! 😊

# NOTE: The two parser models are uploaded in the Releases Section(due to large size).
